### Hi there👋
My name is Damian Danner and I am a software engineer based out of Brookyln, New York.

About Me
---
I'm a fullstack software engineer currently working on product and analytics platform for a company called Netsmart, a health-tech company base out of the Kansas City area. Excited to work on cool things. When I'm not coding I'm enjoying time spent with family and friends, practicing an instrument / making music, or getting outdoors.
