### Hi there👋
My name is Damian Danner and I am a software engineer based out of Brookyln, New York.

About Me
---
I'm a fullstack software engineer who is finishing up a little sabbatical after previously working on product and analytics platform for a company called Netsmart the last 3.5 years. Most of my professional experience is in health tech but I am excited to work on anything cool. When I'm not coding I'm enjoying time spent with family and friends, practicing an instrument / making music, or getting outdoors.
